# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Louise's previous play almost met the fundraising goal in a relatively short amount of time. The purpose of this project was to help her analyze other fundrasing efforts based on launch date and fundraising goal, and to visualize the data for her to understand more easily. 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to help Louise visualize data based on launch date and fundraising goal easily. 

## Analysis and Challenges

In summary, the analysis was conducting by taking her larger data set of 4000 rows and breaking it into smaller, more manageable data and vizualizing the trends in charts for Louise. Challenges were met in terms of understanding what exactly she the end goal of the visual was, and overcame by making important choices. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Outcomes based on launchdate demonstrate that demonstrate that the peak theather campains in terms of success occurred around the May/June time frame with lower peaks in Feb?march and Oct/November. 

There were consistently more successful campains than failed, and very few campains were canceled. 

The least successful campaign month was December, slightly ahead of failed campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Outcomes based on goals demonstrates a reflective relationship where the percent successful and the percent failed proporitionally change based on one another. 

The highest percent of success occurred in campaigns less than 1000, followed by peaks at the 1000to 4999, 35000 to 39999, and 40000 to 44999 tiers. 

Similarly the failed campgaigns peaked at the 40000 to 44999 and 45000 to 49999 tiers followed by the 5000 to 9999 and 10000 to 14999 tiers. 

This chart demonstrates taht the focus of Louise's campaigns should be on the less than 1000 to 4999 and 35000 to 44999 tiers, where they have had the most success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The biggest challenge of analyzing the data was definitely understanding that the percent failed was 0% across all the rows in the Outcomes based on Goals sheet and chart. 

I genuinely thought there was something wrong with the data, but quickly realized the almost symbiotic relationships of the percents failed versus percents successful and learned to accept and ignore this lack of data. 

Another area that presented a challenge was the size of the data set.

The two sheets, including filtering the data on the main Kickstarter sheet of the workbook caused my excel program to crash and stumble repeatedly, but after a few restarts, the work was able to continue. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Peak campaigns occurred between May and June, followed by Feb and March, and Octover and November.

The least successful campaings occurred in December. 

Given the timing, Louise should focus her campains around these specific successful months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The campaigns around the less than 1000 to 4999 and 35000 to 44999 tend to be the most successful for Louise, with the peak at less than 1000. 

These are the areas where Louise should focus running campaigs and definitely focuss leasts on campaigns at or over 45000, where they are least successful. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

There are many limits to the dataset, including  an analysis of which subcategorty of the parent category of Theater campaigns may be more successful or not, and a comparison of data over time. 

This data coalesces all data into one set, but one could create a chart trending over years to determine if some years were better than others. 

This data combined with external data like world events, theater seasons, global economic activity and more could help share more insight into where the successes and failures occurred.

Region and currency are also included in the main Kickstarter sheet, which could also assist in analyzing successful campaigns. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

As indicated above, to give a better understandable picture of the data, multiple tables could be created, including outcomes based on year, outcomes based on region or currency, and perhaps a comparison of outcomes by subcategory.
